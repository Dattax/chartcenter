**How Helm 3 and Helm Charts Create Reproducible Security**

Helm 3 is developing a set of best practices that help make Kubernetes applications more secure. As a recent graduate from incubation to full-fledged project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Helm has is developing its own ecosystem and is working towards mature tooling. Join Rancher and JFrog as they provide more details into updates in Helm 3 and how Helm Charts create reproducible security in the Kubernetes ecosystem. During the masterclass, you’ll get to see how Helm charts can be deployed in production and get hands-on with how to inspect container processes, control your application state, and manage reproducible security in your builds. We’ll also look at a new way to manage security mitigations with JFrog's ChartCenter and dive deeper into:

* Helm 3
* Why to use trusted registries
* Vulnerabilities and mitigation in your chart’s dependencies
* More details around RBAC and cluster roles
* Certificates, signatures, and verification
* Secrets management best practices and more!
