# Our Public Roadmap 
Explore the issues we're considering to add to the next version of HelmCenter:

## HelmCenter Helm Plugin
The plugin empowers users by sharing more metadata on the client side, will have optimized search and there wonâ€™t be any need to configure helmcenter as a helm repository since it will be set as the default value by the plugin.

## Improved Inclusion Process

## Namespace pages and list of all available packages
