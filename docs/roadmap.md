# Our Public Roadmap 
Explore the issues we're considering to add to the next version of ChartCenter:

# Security Mitigation UI
We're working on a robust solution to allow maintainers to users to engage on mitigation notes for the security tab in ChartCenter. 

## ChartCenter Helm Plugin
The plugin empowers users by sharing more metadata on the client side, will have optimized search and there wonâ€™t be any need to configure chartcenter as a helm repository since it will be set as the default value by the plugin.

## Improved Inclusion Process

## Namespace pages and list of all available packages
